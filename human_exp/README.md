# Human inspection experiment
To support the results presented in Figure 3, we have developed an interface for conducting human experiments. Before running the interface, first unzip the img file in the same folder. In this repo, we provide a demo of the Narcissus attack in an .html file, which can be accessed through the `huamn_label_interface.html`.  The interface allows human labelers to assess whether an image is poisoned by using the "yes" or "no" button. Additionally, they can go back to the previous image to change their decision if needed. Once 1000 samples have been cleaned, the browser will automatically download the result.csv file. Reviewers can compare these results with the gound_trouth.xlsx to calculate the NCR.
